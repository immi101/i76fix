Patch for Interstate '76 & Interstate '76 Nitro Pack (GOG Version)


Changes:

- limits framerate to 25fps which prevents wonky physics that occur on higher framerates
- disable ancient cpu measurement code which doesn't run as normal user on NT based system

Note:
This does not work with the original CD version.
It was created using the GOG release of the game, which ships the following exe files:

9a232dcc2c164648cff20c414c1f9698  i76.exe

28b8ae276e88f4ffb13f17df159f09dc  nitro.exe

(!! the patcher doesn't check the exe before patching )

The code here mostly serves as documentation since keeping track of binary editing EXE files is rather
painful.
Most likely you only want to download the patched exe under "releases".
Or download the patcher and patch the exe yourself.
